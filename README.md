## Advantages of B-LoRA

1. Can differentiate `Style` and `Content`.

2. Much smaller model files. (~100M)

3. Only need one image to train.

## Workflow Examples

### A Single Load B-LoRA node

![workflow](workflows/load_b_lora.png)
ðŸŒŸ `<s>` is the training prompt for one B-Lora `colorful-squirrel`

### A B-LoRA for Style, and another for Content

![workflow](workflows/style_plus_content.png)
ðŸŒŸ `<s>` is the training prompt for one B-Lora `colorful-squirrel`, and `<p>` is the training prompt for the other `pencil-boy`.
