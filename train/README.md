# Training Your Own B-LoRA models (WIP)

Since the training process is quite short, it is possible for anyone to train their own B-LoRA.

The instruction and code is here: https://github.com/yardenfren1996/B-LoRA/ , however, installing the dependencies might be not very friendly for beginners.

I am planning to make a docker image, so that users can quickly train their B-LoRA without worrying too much about the dependencies.

This is still working in progress. Coming soon.
